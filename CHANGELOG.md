# Changelog

## v3.0.1 — Per-Process Hook Shared Memory & Audit Fixes (2026-04-01)

### Changed
- **Per-process shared memory** — Each injected eqgame.exe gets its own memory-mapped file (`EQSwitchHookCfg_{PID}`) instead of a single global mapping. Hook DLL now works in both single and multimonitor modes with correct per-window positioning.
- **Atomic config writes** — `ConfigManager.FlushSave` writes to a temp file then `File.Move` to prevent config corruption on crash.

### Fixed
- **Hook configs not updated after ArrangeWindows/ToggleMultiMonitor** — Hook DLL would snap windows back to stale positions after "Fix Windows" or mode toggle.
- **Hook configs not updated after SwapWindows** — Multimonitor swap would be immediately undone by the hook.
- **DllInjector handle leaks** — `hThread` handles in both `Inject()` and `Eject()` moved into `finally` blocks.
- **DllInjector.Eject dead code** — Removed unused `allocAddr`/`VirtualFreeEx` and stale `ResolveLoadLibraryA` call.
- **GetExportRva missing guards** — Added `-1` checks after `RvaToFileOffset` calls for clearer PE parse errors.
- **HookConfigWriter resource leak** — `Open()` catch path now disposes both `MemoryMappedFile` and `ViewAccessor` on failure.
- **HookConfigWriter.Disable zeroed geometry** — Now read-modify-writes to only flip the `Enabled` flag.
- **Dead-PID injection race** — Timer tick guards against injecting into a process that died during the 2s delay.
- **Missing client early-return** — `UpdateHookConfigForPid` logs and returns when PID not in client list.
- **Stream leak in LoadIcon** — `GetManifestResourceStream` now disposed with `using`.
- **SettingsForm font leaks** — Inline fonts on labels and DataGridView header tracked and disposed.
- **Double-dispose of foreground debounce timer** — Removed redundant dispose in `TrayManager.Dispose`.
- **PID naming contract** — Cast to `uint` for shared memory name to match C++ `%lu` formatting.

## v3.0.0 — DLL Hook Injection, Auto-Login & PiP Overhaul (2026-04-01)

### Added
- **DLL hook injection** (`Core/DllInjector.cs`, `Native/eqswitch-hook.dll`) — Injects a native MinHook-based DLL into eqgame.exe that hooks `SetWindowPos` and `MoveWindow`. Enforces window position/style via shared memory-mapped config (`HookConfigWriter.cs`). Prevents EQ from fighting window management.
- **DPAPI-encrypted auto-login** (`Core/AutoLoginManager.cs`, `Core/CredentialManager.cs`) — Account presets with username, encrypted password, server, character name, and slot. Full enter-world automation via `SendInput` on a background thread. Credentials encrypted with `DataProtectionScope.CurrentUser` — only the same Windows user on the same machine can decrypt.
- **Login Accounts model** (`Models/LoginAccount.cs`) — Stored account presets for auto-login with name, username, encrypted password, server, character, slot, and login flag toggle.
- **PiP orientation support** — PiP overlays adapt to window orientation and layout changes.
- **Hook config shared memory** (`Core/HookConfigWriter.cs`) — Memory-mapped file (`EQSwitchHookCfg`) shared between C# host and injected DLL. Struct-matched layout (packed, sequential ints) for target position, style, and enable flag.
- **Native hook source** (`Native/`) — Full MinHook source (buffer, trampoline, HDE32/64 disassembler) plus `eqswitch-hook.cpp` with build scripts for MSVC and MinGW.

### Changed
- **Settings expanded** — New Auto-Login tab with account management, credential encryption, and launch integration.
- **PipOverlay enhanced** — 87 lines added for orientation-aware thumbnail rendering.
- **TrayManager expanded** (982 → 1549 lines) — Auto-login menu integration, DLL injection lifecycle, hook config management.
- **SettingsForm expanded** (734 → 1211 lines) — Auto-login account editor, DLL hook controls, PiP orientation settings.
- **README updated** with new feature descriptions.

### Removed
- **Unit test project** (`EQSwitch.Tests/`) — Removed during architecture transition. Tests covered v2.x patterns that no longer apply post-DLL injection.
- **Solution file** — Simplified to single-project build.
- **PLAN_DLL_HOOK.md** — Planning doc removed after implementation.

## v2.9.1 — Settings & Launch Cleanup (2026-03-30)

### Changed
- **Tray clicks simplified** — Removed triple-click entirely. Left button: single + double click. Middle button: single + triple (via click counting — `MouseDoubleClick` doesn't fire for middle on `NotifyIcon`).
- **Launch is bare-bones** — Removed `EnforceOverrides`, `EnforceWindowedModeIfBorderless`, `PositionOnTargetMonitor`, and post-launch `ArrangeWindows`. Launch just starts `eqgame.exe` with staggered delay. Added restore-if-minimized after 3s.
- **Settings UI cleanup** — Removed CtrlHoverHelp (unreliable in overflow tray). Human-readable switch mode labels ("Swap Last" / "Cycle All"). Tray Click Actions card redesigned. Preferences card alignment fixed.
- **Paths tab auto-open** — Clicking GINA or Dalaya Patcher in launcher menu opens Settings → Paths tab if path not set.
- **Tooltip Delay** — Renamed, supports 0 = disabled.
- **Multi-Monitor Mode checkbox** in Video Settings synced with config.

### Fixed
- **eqclient.ini corruption** — `EnforceOverrides` was writing `Maximized=1` and offsets=-8 on every launch, causing windows to minimize. Removed from launch path entirely.
- Hotkeys tab overlapping labels in Actions card — clean 2-column grid.

---

## v2.9.0 — UI Consolidation & Multi-Monitor (2026-03-30)

### Added
- **Multi-monitor video settings** — Monitor picker, per-monitor resolution, position preview.
- **Config backup restore** — Restore from any of the 10 backup rotations.

### Changed
- **Tabs consolidated** — Merged Performance + Launch into Hotkeys tab. Reduced from 8 to 6 tabs.
- **Stacked fullscreen as default layout** — Clients stack on top of each other, arranged in stacked mode.
- **FPS writes to [Options] section** — Correct INI section for MaxFPS/MaxBGFPS.
- **Priority default changed to AboveNormal** (was High).
- **Process Manager redesigned** — Priority card moved to top, CPU thread mapping card, grid refresh paused during edits.
- **Video Settings overhaul** — Reordered submenu, preset sizes fixed.

### Fixed
- **DefaultFont crash** — Null reference on systems without default font.
- **Launch positioning** — Don't force window offsets on every launch, respect user INI edits.
- **PiP anchor** — Fixed anchor point for overlay positioning.
- **Dalaya patcher** path handling.
- Direct switch hotkeys (Alt+1-6) disabled by default to avoid conflicts.
- Hotkey conflict warning appearing on every Settings close.
- PiP max windows label layout and custom size capped to 960×720.

### Removed
- **Swap Windows** feature — removed (stacked mode replaces it).
- **CharacterEditDialog** — removed (per-character overrides simplified).

---

## v2.8.0 — Slim Titlebar / WinEQ2 Mode (2026-03-30)

### Added
- **Slim titlebar mode** (WinEQ2 style) — Strips `WS_THICKFRAME` (resize border) while keeping `WS_CAPTION` (thin title bar). Positions window at full `rcMonitor` bounds to overlap taskbar. Replaces both "borderless" and "remove title bars" options with a single unified mode.
- **Auto-apply slim titlebar** — Guard timer re-applies style when EQ fights the window decoration changes.
- **EQClientSettingsForm expanded** — Additional eqclient.ini toggle controls.

### Changed
- **WindowManager rewritten** (280+ lines changed) — Unified slim titlebar logic, monitor bounds calculation, style manipulation.
- **Settings Layout tab** — Slim titlebar checkbox replaces borderless + remove-title-bar checkboxes.
- **LaunchManager simplified** — Removed post-launch window positioning (slim titlebar handles it).

### Removed
- **ROADMAP.md** — Removed from project (tracked in root `Roadmap_master.md`).
- **Borderless fullscreen mode** — Superseded by slim titlebar mode.
- **Remove Title Bars option** — Superseded by slim titlebar mode.

---

## v2.7.0 — Process Manager Consolidation (2026-03-28)

### Added
- **Consolidated Process Manager** — 3 clear cards: Windows Priority, Core Assignment, FPS Limits
- **INI-based Core Assignment** — 6 NumericUpDown slot pickers for CPUAffinity0-5, writes directly to eqclient.ini
- **Ghost FPS label** — shows current eqclient.ini MaxFPS/MaxBGFPS values alongside the editor

### Changed
- **FPS defaults** changed to 80/80 (was 0 = unlimited, which crashes EQ)
- **Priority defaults** changed to High/High (prevents virtual desktop crashes + enables autofollow)
- **Settings "Affinity" tab renamed to "Performance"** — stripped to enable toggle + retry settings
- **Submenu directions** — Video Settings, Settings, Launcher all open upward (AboveRight)
- **CharacterEditDialog simplified** — priority override only (core assignment now global via eqclient.ini)

### Removed
- **ThrottleManager** — process suspension was causing "Suspended" in Task Manager
- **CPU Affinity submenu** from tray menu — Process Manager is the one-stop shop
- **Per-character AffinityOverride** — replaced by global eqclient.ini CPUAffinity0-5 slots

---

## v2.6.0 — Per-Character Overrides (2026-03-20)

### Added
- **Per-character CPU affinity** — assign different core masks to individual characters. Characters with `AffinityOverride` use their custom mask instead of the global active/background masks.
- **Per-character process priority** — set individual characters to Normal, AboveNormal, or High priority. Characters with `PriorityOverride` use their custom priority instead of the global setting.
- **Character Edit dialog** — double-click a character in Settings → Characters tab to edit affinity mask and priority overrides. Checkbox toggles override on/off, hex mask input with validation.
- **Process Manager "Source" column** — shows "Custom" (cyan) for clients using per-character overrides, "Global" for clients using default settings.
- **Reset Defaults button in Video Settings form** — resets Width/Height (1920×1080), offsets (0,0), Windowed Mode (on), Disable Log (off), Title Bar Offset (0). Matches AHK v2.4 `ResetVMDefaults`. Requires Save or Apply to write to disk.

---

## v2.4.0 — Tray UX Overhaul (2026-03-14)

### Added
- **Configurable tray click actions** — Settings → General tab lets users bind single/double/triple/middle-click to specific actions (Launch One, Fix Windows, Open Settings, etc.)
- **Custom video presets** — Save up to 3 custom resolutions in Video Settings (FIFO eviction, duplicates skipped)
- **Dark-themed context menus** — `DarkMenuRenderer` applies dark background/foreground to all tray menu items
- **FloatingTooltip** — replaces `MessageBox.Show` "already running" popup with a non-blocking floating tooltip

### Changed
- **Tray context menu reorganized** into grouped submenus (Video Settings, Settings, Launcher)
- **Medieval emoji/icon prefixes** restored on all tray menu items (matches AHK v2.4 style)
- **CPU Affinity submenu simplified** — removed per-core checkboxes, shows info labels only
- **Process Manager** restyled with dark DataGridView theme
- **First-run** now auto-opens Settings instead of requiring manual navigation

---

## v2.3.0 — Performance & Fullscreen (2026-03-13)

### Added
- **Background FPS throttling** (`Core/ThrottleManager.cs`) — duty-cycles background EQ clients via `NtSuspendProcess`/`NtResumeProcess`. Configurable throttle percent (0-90%) and cycle interval. Active client is never throttled. Settings on Affinity tab.
- **Borderless fullscreen mode** — WinEQ Y+1 offset trick: strips window decorations and positions at `(monitor.Left, monitor.Top+1)` using `rcMonitor` bounds. Preserves Alt+Tab and PiP window overlay. Checkbox on Layout tab.

---

## v2.2.0 — Production Hardening (2026-03-12)

### Added
- **Persistent file logging** (`Core/FileLogger.cs`): Info/Warn/Error with timestamp, 1MB rotation, thread-safe
- **Input validation** (`AppConfig.Validate()`): Clamps all numeric config fields to safe ranges on load and save
- **IWindowsApi interface** (`Core/IWindowsApi.cs`): Abstraction layer for Win32 calls, enables unit testing
- **79 unit tests** across 7 test files: AppConfig, WindowManager, AffinityManager, ConfigManager, ConfigMigration, HotkeyManager, EQClient
- **Solution file** (`EQSwitch.sln`): Main project + xUnit test project with Moq

### Fixed
- **P2-02**: Context menu client labels now update when window titles change
- **Concurrency**: KeyboardHookManager uses `ImmutableHashSet<int>` (lock-free) instead of `HashSet<int>` with lock
- **Concurrency**: ProcessManager fires events outside lock block, uses specific exception catches
- **Concurrency**: AffinityManager snapshots retry counters before iterating
- **Resource leak**: LaunchManager implements IDisposable, cancels launches on dispose
- **Resource leak**: ProcessManagerForm stops refresh timer in Dispose()
- **Backup pruning**: ConfigManager sorts by file write time instead of filename string
- **Hotkey ID overflow**: `_nextId` resets to 1 on `UnregisterAll()` (P4-01)
- **Exception hardening**: DWM HRESULT mapped to readable messages in PipOverlay
- **Exception hardening**: VideoSettingsForm retries file I/O (2x, 500ms)
- **Magic numbers**: Named constants replace all magic numbers across 6 files

### Changed
- All diagnostic logging migrated from `Debug.WriteLine` to `FileLogger`
- WindowManager and AffinityManager accept optional `IWindowsApi` for dependency injection

## v2.1.1 — Post-Release Audit Fixes (2026-03-12)

### Fixed
- **P0-01**: Hook callback dispatched async via SynchronizationContext.Post() — prevents Windows killing the LL hook on slow callbacks
- **P0-02**: Global switch key `]` no longer swallowed when zero EQ clients running (requireClients guard + cached PID check)
- **P0-03**: PiP overlay Ctrl+drag works — replaced WS_EX_TRANSPARENT with dynamic WM_NCHITTEST (HTTRANSPARENT default, HTCLIENT when Ctrl held)
- **P0-04**: eqclient.ini read/write uses ANSI encoding instead of UTF-8 to prevent corruption
- **P1-01**: Eliminated Process.GetProcessById() in hook callback — cached PID HashSet with GetWindowThreadProcessId
- **P1-02**: Screen.PrimaryScreen null-safe fallback for headless/RDP disconnect
- **P1-03**: All eqclient.ini file operations use Encoding.Default consistently
- **P1-04**: Triple-click tray detection resets timestamp on every click
- **P1-05**: Run-at-startup registry path validated on launch — auto-corrects if exe moved
- **P1-06**: LaunchManager timers cancelled on config reload and shutdown
- **P1-07**: Minimum 500ms enforced between staggered launches
- **P1-08**: ContextMenuStrip disposed in Shutdown path
- **P1-09**: Previous custom icon disposed on LoadIcon reload
